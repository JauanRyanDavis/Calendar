Calendar Program

The purpose of this program is to create/print out a full year's calendar based on the input of a user. The program asks 
the user the year the calendar is to display and what week day does the calendar begin. It is configured to check for leap
years and adjusts the calendar accordingly. The leap year feature of the program was the only tricky part of getting it to
work properly but once that was completed the rest was straight forward.
